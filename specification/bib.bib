When the underlying block cipher is secure in the sense of a strong pseudorandom permutation (PRP), our scheme is secure in the sense of tweakable, strong PRP. Such an object can be used to encipher the sectors of a disk, in-place, offering security as good as can be obtained in this setting. CMC makes a pass of CBC encryption, xors in a mask, and then makes a pass of CBC decryption; no universal hashing, nor any other non-trivial operation beyond the block-cipher calls, is employed. Besides proving the security of CMC we initiate a more general investigation of tweakable enciphering schemes, considering issues like the non-malleability of these objects."

The mode is parallelizable, but as serial-efficient as the non-parallelizable mode CMC [6]. EME can be used to solve the disk-sector encryption problem. The algorithm entails two layers of ECB encryption and a ``lightweight mixing'' in between. We prove EME secure, in the reduction-based sense of modern cryptography. We motivate some of the design choices in EME by showing that a few simple modifications of this mode are insecure."

PEP uses a hash-encrypt-hash approach which has been recently used in the construction of HCTR. This approach is different from the encrypt-mask-encrypt approach of constructions such as CMC, EME and EME*. The general hash-encrypt-hash approach was earlier used by Naor-Reingold to provide a generic construction technique for an SPRP (but not a tweakable SPRP). PEP can be seen as the development of the Naor-Reingold approach into a fully specified mode of operation with a concrete security reduction for a tweakable strong pseudo-random permutation. HCTR is also based on the Naor-Reingold approach but its security bound is weaker than PEP. Compared to previous known constructions, PEP is the only known construction of tweakable SPRP which uses a single key, is efficiently parallelizable and can handle an arbitrary number of blocks."

At Crypto 2007, Halevi presented constructions of invertible block-wise universal hash functions and a new mode of operation (called TET) based on them. In this paper, we present a new mode of operation called HEH using the Naor-Reingold approach. This is built using a new construction of invertible block-wise universal hash function. The new construction improves over Halevi's construction by removing restrictions on the hashing key. This in turn, leads to HEH improving over TET by allowing more efficient encryption and decryption of variable length messages as well as supporting better key agility. For the important application of disk encryption, we present a variant called HEHfp which has better key agility than TET."

In this paper, we provide a proof of security for XCB, and show that it is a secure tweakable (super) pseudorandom permutation. Our analysis makes several new contributions: it uses an algebraic property of XCB's internal universal hash function to simplify the proof, and it defines a nonce mode in which XCB can be securely used even when the plaintext is shorter than twice the width of the underlying block cipher. We also show minor modifications that improve the performance of XCB and make it easier to analyze. XCB is interesting because it is highly efficient in both hardware and software, it has no alignment restrictions on input lengths, it can be used in nonce mode, and it uses the internal functions of the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of operation, which facilitates design re-use and admits multi-purpose implementations."

We prove that HCTR is a strong tweakable pseudorandom permutation (                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}widetilde{\{}sprp{\}}{\$}                ), when the underlying blockcipher is a strong pseudorandom permutation (sprp). HCTR is shown to be a very efficient mode of operation when some pre-computations are taken into consideration. Arbitrary variable input length brings much flexibility in various application environments. HCTR can be used in disk sector encryption, and other length-preserving encryptions, especially for the message that is not multiple of n bits."

Our VIL mode of operation makes a variable-input-length cipher from any block cipher. The method is demonstrably secure in the provable-security sense of modern cryptography: we give a quantitative security analysis relating the difficulty of breaking the constructed (variable-input-length) cipher to the difficulty of breaking the underlying block cipher."

Such a cipher has not only the usual inputs --- message and cryptographic key --- but also a third input, the ``tweak.'' The tweak serves much the same purpose that an initialization vector does for CBC mode or that a nonce does for OCB mode. Our proposal thus brings this feature down to the primitive block-cipher level, instead of incorporating it only at the higher modes-of-operation levels. We suggest that (1) tweakable block ciphers are easy to design, (2) the extra cost of making a block cipher ``tweakable'' is small, and (3) it is easier to design and prove modes of operation based on tweakable block ciphers."

The method is based on composing four (or three for weakened security) so-called Feistel permutations, each of which requires the evaluation of a pseudorandom function. We reduce somewhat the complexity of the construction and simplify its proof of security by showing that two Feistel permutations are sufficient together with initial and final pairwise independent permutations. The revised construction and proof provide a framework in which similar constructions may be brought up and their security can be easily proved. We demonstrate this by presenting some additional adjustments of the construction that achieve the following:"

,    abstract="Salsa20 is a family of 256-bit stream ciphers designed in 2005 and submitted to eSTREAM, the ECRYPT Stream Cipher Project. Salsa20 has progressed to the third round of eSTREAM without any changes. The 20-round stream cipher Salsa20/20 is consistently faster than AES and is recommended by the designer for typical cryptographic applications. The reduced-round ciphers Salsa20/12 and Salsa20/8 are among the fastest 256-bit stream ciphers available and are recommended for applications where speed is more important than confidence. The fastest known attacks use ≈{\thinspace}2153 simple operations against Salsa20/7, ≈{\thinspace}2249 simple operations against Salsa20/8, and ≈{\thinspace}2255 simple operations against Salsa20/9, Salsa20/10, etc. In this paper, the Salsa20 designer presents Salsa20 and discusses the decisions made in the Salsa20 design."

Though HCTR is quite an efficient mode, the authors showed a cubic security bound for HCTR which makes it unsuitable for applications where tweakable strong pseudorandom permutations are required. In this paper we show that HCTR has a better security bound than what the authors showed. We prove that the distinguishing advantage of an adversary in distinguishing HCTR and its inverse from a random permutation and its inverse is bounded above by $4.5\sigma^2/2^n$, where n is the block-length of the block-cipher and $\sigma$ is the number of n-block queries made by the adversary (including the tweak).}

Here we introduce a new notion of security, KDM security, appropriate for key-dependent messages. The notion makes sense in both the publickey and shared-key settings. For the latter we show that KDM security is easily achievable within the random-oracle model. By developing and achieving stronger notions of encryption-scheme security it is hoped that protocols which are proven secure under ``formal'' models of security can, in time, be safely realized by generically instantiating their primitives."

To achieve such speeds, UMAC uses a new universal hash-function family, NH, and a design which allows effective exploitation of SIMD parallelism. The ``cryptographic'' work of UMAC is done using standard primitives of the user's choice, such as a block cipher or cryptographic hash function; no new heuristic primitives are developed here. Instead, the security of UMAC is rigorously proven, in the sense of giving exact and quantitatively strong results which demonstrate an inability to forge UMAC-authenticated messages assuming an inability to break the underlying cryptographic primitive. Unlike conventional, inherently serial MACs, UMAC is parallelizable, and will have ever-faster implementation speeds as machines offer up increasing amounts of parallelism. We envision UMAC as a practical algorithm for next-generation message authentication."

For t{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1, Even and Mansour proved indistinguishability security up to 2n/2 queries, which is tight. Much later Bogdanov et al. (2011) conjectured that security should be {\$}2^{\{}{\backslash}frac{\{}t{\}}{\{}t+1{\}}n{\}}{\$}queries for general t, which matches an easy distinguishing attack (so security cannot be more).
